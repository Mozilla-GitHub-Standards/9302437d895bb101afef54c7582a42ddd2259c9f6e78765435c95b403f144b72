# Transpilers

*Transpiler: a script that takes one syntax (typically a non-standard scripting, document or style syntax) and transforms it  into the web-standard languages of HTML, Javascript and CSS*

There is an increasing proliferation of alternate syntaxes being used by web developers that rely on command-line scripts to transform the alternate syntax

## More popular examples

* Coffeescript ( => JS )
* Livescript ( => JS )
* ClojureScript ( => JS )
* SASS ( => CSS )
* LESS ( => CSS )
* Stylus ( => CSS )
* Jade ( => HTML )
* HAML ( => HAML )

## Rising Prevalence

If you use node's express framework to write apps, by default you get a stubbed app that uses Javascript, Stylus and Jade, and express handles the transpilation to CSS and JS.

Likewise, conferences like TXJS feature several talks on SASS or Stylus, espousing the varous advantages of using the alternative syntax particularly for managing styles on large and complex web applications.
