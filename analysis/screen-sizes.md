# Screen Sizes

Screen resolutions are a tricky thing. 1080p LCD Monitors have gotten so cheap that both desktop and 'docked laptop' users are using huge monitors when we find them in a traditional office setting.

What complicates matters is that developers are increasingly seeking out non-traditional settings for at least part of the time: airplanes, hack days, cafes, the couch:

### Fragmentation

Statcounter's stats for screen sizes worldwide is interesting, by far the most dominant screen resolution is the oddball [1366x768](http://gs.statcounter.com/#resolution-ww-monthly-201207-201307) - a native panel resolution for cheap televisions as well as the LCD display in the 11' Macbook Air and other similar machines such as the 11' [Lenova 'Yoga'](http://shop.lenovo.com/ca/en/landingpage/yoga/yoga-models.html#yoga-content).

Ultrabooks (led by the Macbook Air) are [growing steadily even though the rest of the market is declining][http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/29/3125801/ultrabook-sales-boost-notebook-market]. Particularly in North America screen sizes are getting smaller and wider.

Other standard sizes that are very common 

#### Uneven distribution

North America is a Macbook soap bubble, and the developer market in North America can be observed as an extreme example of this. [Apple's market share in America is over 10% in the US but does not even make it in the top 5 worldwide](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/14/apple-continues-slow-but-steady-growth-in-us-laptop-market-share/). We see this all around us - developer events in the US and Canada ( especially in major cities ) are dominated by Apple hardware. 

Once you leave North America ( and to a lesser extent, Europe ) the Apple dominance disappears. In my travels to Asia and Brazil to stage at developer events I was reminded of just how stark this difference is, and why. The developers I met tend to choose much cheaper PC laptops (and often use Linux on them) due mainly to economics. Apple's hardware is far too expensive, and this is particularly acute in places like Brazil where import taxes on fully assembled foreign products can double the retail price.

While Apple's line has relatively few models and a short list of screen resolutions, PC screen sizes present real problems to us: not only are there a lot of screen sizes in use, but many laptops have very high (1080p) resolutions paired with physical sizes that make readability challenging.
